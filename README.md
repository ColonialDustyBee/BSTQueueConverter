# BSTQueueConverter (Project Created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)

This project aims to create a Binary Search Tree from reading a .txt file and then converting that same BST into a queue.

To get started on this project you will need to create a .txt file with the word "PutItem" followed by a random number in the .txt file.

This will ensure that the BST is properly created.

Afterwards, it will generate a queue where it will generate a .txt file while dumping the numbers that are within the queue in ascending order to show that the BST to Queue works as intended.
