# BSTQueueConverter (Project Created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)

This project aims to create a Binary Search Tree from reading a .txt file and then converting that same BST into a queue.

To get started on this project you will need to create a .txt file with the word "PutItem" followed by a random number in the .txt file.

This will ensure that the BST is properly created.

Afterwards you are welcome to run through various commands that the BST has alongside with beginning the conversion into a queue respectively.
